**Independent Researcher** | **Large Language Models, AI for Law and Chemistry, LLM Interpretability**

Biquan Bie is an independent researcher focusing on the theoretical underpinnings and practical applications of **LLMs**. 
He graduated from the Experimental High School Attached to Beijing Normal University (**SDSZ**) in 2020
He received his Bachelor's degree from the Department of Artificial Intelligence and Automation at Beijing University of Technology (**BJUT**) in 2024.

He completed his undergraduate thesis on: ***Explainable Artificial-Intelligence-Based Legal Reasoning Systems***

His research focuses on systematically integrating LLMs with **domain-specific knowledge** to build verifiable automated applications that address precisely defined domain requirements. Additionally, he explores the cognitive processes within LLMs through the lens of **human-compatible machine intelligence**, employing psychological theories and explainability techniques to understand their reasoning.


Key Projects & Publications:
====
**2024**

**Trustworthy Legal Reasoning Agent** (*Internal Testing*):

A collaborative project with CUPL focused on developing a deployable multi-agent framework for **explainable and reliable legal reasoning**.

**2025**

**Research on Anchoring Effects in Large Language Models** (*Available on arXiv*):

A collaborative study with HKUST(GZ) investigating a typical human-compatible cognitive bias **anchoring effect** in LLMs both internally and externally.
[An Empirical Study of the Anchoring Effect in LLMs: Existence, Mechanism, and Potential Mitigations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15392)


**Multi-Agent Framework for Automated Construction of Domain-Specific Large Language Models** (*Forthcoming on arXiv*):

A joint effort with DLUT to develop an end-to-end multi-agent system for building light-weighted specialized LLMs, automating (1) **data synthesis**, (2) **model training and monitoring** and (3) **downstream knowledge application**.

Long-term Research Goals:
======
His long-term research goals include exploring the application of **Reinforcement Learning for LLMs**,  leveraging **Formal Methods** to enhance the robustness and reliability of LLMs, and developing **LLM-driven automated productivity applications**.
