**Independent Researcher** | **Large Language Models, AI for Law and Chemistry, LLM Interpretability**

Biquan Bie is an independent researcher focusing on the theoretical underpinnings and practical applications of **LLMs**. 
He graduated from the Experimental High School Attached to Beijing Normal University (**SDSZ**) in 2020
He received his Bachelor's degree from the Department of Artificial Intelligence and Automation at Beijing University of Technology (**BJUT**) in 2024.

He completed his undergraduate thesis on: ***Explainable Artificial-Intelligence-Based Legal Reasoning Systems***

His research focuses on systematically integrating LLMs with **domain-specific knowledge** to build **verifiable automated applications** that address **precisely defined domain requirements**. Additionally, he explores the **cognitive processes** within LLMs through the lens of **comparable human intelligence**, employing psychological theories and **explainability techniques** to understand their reasoning.


**Key Projects & Publications:**
=====
Trustworthy Legal Reasoning Agent (Internal Testing): 
====
A collaborative project with China University of Political Science and Law focused on developing a reliable AI agent for legal reasoning.
Research on Anchoring Effects in Large Language Models (Forthcoming on arXiv):
====
A collaborative study with the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) investigating anchoring biases in LLMs.
Multi-Agent Framework for Automated Construction of Domain-Specific Large Language Models (Forthcoming on arXiv):
===
A joint effort with Dalian University of Technology to develop an end-to-end multi-agent system for building specialized LLMs.

Long-term Research Goals:
====
His long-term research goals include exploring the application of Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Models (RL4LLM), leveraging Formal Methods to enhance the robustness and reliability of LLMs, and developing LLM-driven automated productivity applications.
