Biquan Bie
====
Independent Researcher | Large Language Models, AI for Law and Chemistry, LLM Interpretability

Biquan Bie is an independent researcher focusing on the theoretical underpinnings and practical applications of large language models (LLMs). He graduated from the Experimental High School Attached to Beijing Normal University in 2020 and received his Bachelor's degree from the Department of Artificial Intelligence and Automation at Beijing University of Technology (BJUT) in 2024.

His current research interests lie in the synergistic integration of LLMs with domain-specific knowledge to develop automated applications with tangible value. Additionally, he explores the cognitive processes within LLMs through the lens of comparable human intelligence, employing psychological theories and explainability techniques to understand their reasoning.

**Key Projects & Publications:**
=====
**Trustworthy Legal Reasoning Agent (Internal Testing):** A collaborative project with China University of Political Science and Law focused on developing a reliable AI agent for legal reasoning.
**Research on Anchoring Effects in Large Language Models (Forthcoming on arXiv):** A collaborative study with the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) investigating anchoring biases in LLMs.
**Multi-Agent Framework for Automated Construction of Domain-Specific Large Language Models (Forthcoming on arXiv):** A joint effort with Dalian University of Technology to develop an end-to-end multi-agent system for building specialized LLMs.

**Long-term Research Goals:**
His long-term research goals include exploring the application of Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Models (RL4LLM), leveraging Formal Methods to enhance the robustness and reliability of LLMs, and developing LLM-driven automated productivity applications.
